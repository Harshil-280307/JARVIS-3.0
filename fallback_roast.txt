I’d explain it to you, but I left my crayons at home. 🖍️
You bring everyone so much joy… when you leave the room. 🚪
You have something on your chin… no, the third one down. 🤨
You’re as useless as the “ueue” in “queue.” 🔤
Your secrets are safe with me. I never even listen when you tell me them. 🤫
You’re the reason the gene pool needs a lifeguard. 🏊
You’re like a software update – whenever you come, I lose interest. 🔄
You have the perfect face for radio. 📻
You’re as bright as a black hole, and twice as dense. 🌌
If you were any slower, you’d be moving backwards. 🐢
You’re about as sharp as a marble. 🔮
You have the charisma of a damp rag. 🧻
Your brain’s so small, it makes a peanut look like an elephant. 🥜🐘
You’re proof that even evolution has a speed limit. 🦕
You’re like a cloud. When you disappear, it’s a beautiful day. ☀️
If you were a vegetable, you’d be a ‘cabbage.’ 🥬
You have something on your chin again… third one down. 😒
I’d agree with you but then we’d both be wrong. 😤
You’re as useless as a screen door on a submarine. 🛳️
I’d tell you to go to hell, but I work there and don’t want competition. 🔥
